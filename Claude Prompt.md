# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

### Problem Statement
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i`th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses one pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
* `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

### 📌 Multiple Choice Questions: Binary Search Approach  

#### 1️⃣ What is the main idea behind using Binary Search to find the minimum eating speed?  
- [ ] A) Finding a valid speed by trying every possible value linearly  
- [ ] B) Using divide and conquer to split the banana piles  
- [ ] C) Narrowing down the search space of possible speeds efficiently  
- [ ] D) Sorting the piles to optimize the banana consumption

  ✅ **C) Narrowing down the search space of possible speeds efficiently**

#### 2️⃣ Why do we initialize `left = 1` and `right = max(piles)` for the binary search?  
- [ ] A) To ensure we start with the minimum possible speed (1) and the maximum needed speed  
- [ ] B) Because binary search always requires the initial boundaries to be 1 and the maximum value  
- [ ] C) To avoid integer overflow in the calculations  
- [ ] D) Because Koko must eat at least one banana but never needs to eat more than the largest pile in one hour

#### 3️⃣ What does the `math.ceil(pile/mid)` calculation represent in the solution?  
- [ ] A) The number of bananas Koko eats from each pile  
- [ ] B) The hours needed to eat a pile at the current speed (`mid`)  
- [ ] C) The average number of bananas in all piles  
- [ ] D) The remaining bananas in the pile after Koko finishes

  ✅ **B) The hours needed to eat a pile at the current speed (`mid`)**  
</details>

#### 4️⃣ Why do we use `right = mid` (not `right = mid - 1`) when `hours_spent <= h`?  
- [ ] A) To include the current speed as a potential answer since it's valid  
- [ ] B) To avoid an infinite loop in the binary search algorithm  
- [ ] C) Because we're looking for the minimum valid speed, and the current speed might be it  
- [ ] D) Both A and C are correct

#### 5️⃣ What is the time complexity of this binary search solution?  
- [ ] A) O(n log n), where n is the number of piles  
- [ ] B) O(n log m), where n is the number of piles and m is the maximum pile size  
- [ ] C) O(h log n), where h is the number of hours and n is the number of piles  
- [ ] D) O(n²), where n is the number of piles

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            hours_spent = 0

            for pile in piles:
                hours_spent += math.ceil(pile/mid)

            if hours_spent <= h:  # Decrease the speed
                right = mid
            
            else:                # Increase the speed
                left = mid + 1
        
        return right
```
