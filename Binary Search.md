# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

### Problem Statement
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i`th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses one pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
* `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

# 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

### Problem Statement
You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `ith` spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `jth` potion.

You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if the **product** of their strengths is **at least** `success`.

Return *an integer array* `pairs` *of length* `n` *where* `pairs[i]` *is the number of* **potions** *that will form a successful pair with the* `ith` *spell.*

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == spells.length`
* `m == potions.length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
* `1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= success <= 10^10`

# 162. Find Peak Element

### Problem Statement
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -‚àû`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
* `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

### üìå Multiple Choice Questions: Binary Search Approach  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why is binary search a suitable algorithm for finding a peak element?  
- [ ] A) Because the array is guaranteed to be sorted  
- [ ] B) Because we only need to find any peak, not a specific one  
- [ ] C) Because the problem states we need O(log n) time complexity  
- [ ] D) Both B and C are correct  

<details>
  <summary>üí° Answer</summary>
  
  ‚úÖ **D) Both B and C are correct**  
  
  Binary search is suitable because we only need to find any peak (not a specific one), and the problem requires O(log n) time complexity. The solution leverages the fact that by comparing adjacent elements, we can determine which direction to search for a peak.
</details>  

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ In the binary search approach, why do we compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid + 1]` rather than both neighbors?  
- [ ] A) It's a simplification that still guarantees finding a peak  
- [ ] B) It reduces the number of comparisons needed  
- [ ] C) It helps avoid edge cases at array boundaries  
- [ ] D) All of the above  

<details>
  <summary>üí° Answer</summary>
  
  ‚úÖ **A) It's a simplification that still guarantees finding a peak**  
  
  By comparing with just the right neighbor, we can determine which half to search. If nums[mid] > nums[mid+1], we know there's a peak on the left side (including mid itself). If nums[mid] < nums[mid+1], there's a peak on the right side.
</details>  

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ When `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, why do we set `r = mid` (not `r = mid - 1`)?  
- [ ] A) To avoid missing the peak if it's at the current position  
- [ ] B) To handle edge cases when mid is at the array boundaries  
- [ ] C) To ensure the algorithm terminates properly  
- [ ] D) To maintain the O(log n) time complexity  

<details>
  <summary>üí° Answer</summary>
  
  ‚úÖ **A) To avoid missing the peak if it's at the current position**  
  
  When nums[mid] > nums[mid+1], the current position (mid) could be a peak or there might be a peak to its left. Setting r = mid instead of r = mid - 1 ensures we don't exclude mid from our search space.
</details>  

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What property of the problem guarantees that a peak element always exists?  
- [ ] A) The constraint that `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`  
- [ ] B) The assumption that elements outside the array are `-‚àû`  
- [ ] C) The fact that the array has at least one element  
- [ ] D) Both B and C  

<details>
  <summary>üí° Answer</summary>
  
  ‚úÖ **D) Both B and C**  
  
  Since the array has at least one element and elements outside the array are considered `-‚àû`, even a single-element array would have a peak (as both its neighbors would be `-‚àû`). For larger arrays, the fact that adjacent elements cannot be equal (from the constraint) combined with these properties ensures at least one peak exists.
</details>  

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What is the worst-case time complexity of the binary search approach for finding a peak element?  
- [ ] A) O(n)  
- [ ] B) O(log n)  
- [ ] C) O(n log n)  
- [ ] D) O(1)  

<details>
  <summary>üí° Answer</summary>
  
  ‚úÖ **B) O(log n)**  
  
  The binary search algorithm halves the search space in each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the array. This meets the problem's requirement for a O(log n) solution.
</details>  

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```
