# 2503. Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries

### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an array of integer `queries` of size `q`.

For each query `queries[i]`, you need to find the maximum number of points you can collect by starting at cell `(0, 0)` and only moving to cells with values strictly less than `queries[i]`.

You can move up, down, left, or right from a cell to an adjacent cell in the grid. Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[2,5,7],[3,5,1]], queries = [5,6,2]
Output: [5,8,1]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[5,2,1],[1,1,2]], queries = [3]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints:
* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= queries[i] <= 10^6`

### üìå Multiple Choice Questions: Grid BFS with Priority Queue Approach  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the main data structure used to solve this problem efficiently?

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why do we sort the queries before processing them?  
- [ ] A) To optimize the time complexity to O(q log q)  
- [ ] B) To avoid recalculating the BFS for each query  
- [ ] C) To process queries in increasing order, allowing us to reuse previous results  
- [ ] D) All of the above

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What does the `count` variable represent in the solution?  
- [ ] A) The number of queries processed  
- [ ] B) The number of cells visited with values less than the current query  
- [ ] C) The size of the min-heap  
- [ ] D) The maximum value in the grid

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why do we use a min-heap instead of a regular queue for the BFS?  
- [ ] A) To visit cells in order of increasing values  
- [ ] B) To optimize the space complexity  
- [ ] C) To handle the queries more efficiently  
- [ ] D) Because this problem requires Dijkstra's algorithm
